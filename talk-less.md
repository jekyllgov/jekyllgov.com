title: Talk Less, Smile More 
---

Assume that your site visitors arrive with a task in mind and a desire to complete the task as quickly as possible with as little effort as possible. This is usually true. 

Here are 5 ways you can help them find relevent resources and complete the task they set out to complete, in as little time as possible: 

1. **Use plain language.** If users don't understand the terms you use, they might not realize the information or resource they're looking for is right in front of their eyes. 
2. **Make skim-reading easy.** Short paragraphs, bulleted lists, and thoughtful styling choices can help users skim-read a page. Page titles and section headings should be big enough to really stand out, but not so big that they look like banner ads. **Bold** and _italic_ styling can be used to draw attention to important words and phrases. Links should look like links- this usually means blue or some color noticeably different from regular text, as well as other optional indicators such as underlining link text. Be careful about changing text color or adding an underline to any text that is not a link.  
3. **Be consistent.** Predictable styling and layout help users find what they're looking for at a glance. 
4. **Curate.** Every bit of content should serve a purpose; this includes decorative elements like photos. Remove content that is redundant, outdated, or trivial. 
5. **Talk less.** The best way to help people find what they're looking for is to use fewer words. Once you've written your copy text, try to cut the word count in half-- and then in half again. 

Writing for web should be concise, selective, predictable, carefully styled and easy to understand.
